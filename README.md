Bootstrap 3 website with the Bootstrap 2 Marketing Narrow theme


This is the source code for my website. http://www.ulyssesz.com/

The blog is composed of static pages generated with Jekyll.
The rest is a modified version of this [theme](http://www.realpython.com/blog/design/getting-started-with-bootstrap-3/#.Up0KPWSxN4E)
